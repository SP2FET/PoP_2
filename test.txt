Convert lowercase letter to uppercase
Converts c to its uppercase equivalent if c is a lowercase letter and has an uppercase equivalent. If no such conversion is possible, the value returned is c unchanged.
In other locales, if a lowercase character has more than one correspondent uppercase character, this function always returns the same character for the same value of c.
